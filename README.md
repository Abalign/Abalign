# Abalign: a multiple BCR sequence alignment tool guided by antibody numbering


## Introduce

&emsp;&emsp; Multiple sequence alignment has long been used as a powerful tool to investigate the 
evolutionary, structural and functional properties of protein families. Compared with ordinary 
protein families, antibodies or BCR sequences have highly variable regions, which make the 
existing multiple sequence alignment methods unable to produce precise result on antibodies. 
Recently, the increasing data of BCR sequence along with COVID-19's global popularity has 
stimulated the great needs for multiple BCR sequence alignment and bioinformatics analysis. To 
address this issue, we developed a multiple sequence alignment method based on AbRSA, 
named Abalign, which is guided by the heuristic knowledge of standardized antibody sequence 
numbering schemes, including IMGT, KABAT and Chothia systems. The alignment follows the 
well-characterized patterns of conserved or insertion positions by immunology studies, which 
enable the result to be consistent with the structural and immunological knowledge. Abalign was 
implemented in a user-friendly software with interactive and visual interface, which supports the 
multiple sequence alignment, as well as sequence clustering, antibody numbering, 
complementarity-determining region delimiting, constructing phylogenetic tree, V-gene 
determination and abundance analysis by just clicking the buttons for a given FASTA sequence 
file. Abalign allows the high-throughput analysis for BCR sequencing data, which can be finished 
in 420 minutes for 500 Mb sequences (a single thread with AMD CPU 2990WX). We believe that 
Abalign is a powerful and efficient tool for biological researchers to analyze massive amounts of 
BCR or antibody sequences and get new discovery in immunoinformatic study.
