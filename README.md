# Abalignï¼ša BCR multiple sequence alignment tool based on antibody numbering


## Introduce

&emsp;&emsp; Multiple sequence alignment has long been used as a powerful tool to investigate the evolutionary, structural and functional properties of protein families. It is also a fundamental technique in recent deep-learning based protein 3D structure prediction methods. The existing multiple sequence alignment methods are extremely difficult to align the highly variable regions of antibody or B-Cell Receptor (BCR) sequences without the prior knowledge of antibody gene recombination and hypermutation in the process of maturation. This multiple sequence alignment tool, named Abalign, which integrates heuristic knowledge of the standardized antibody sequence numbering schemes, including IMGT, KABAT and Chothia systems. The alignment follows the well-characterized patterns of the conserved or highly variable positions known by immunology studies. Hence the alignment result is consistent with the structural and immunological knowledge. Abalign was implemented in a user-friendly software with interactive and visual interface, which supports the multiple sequence alignment, as well as sequence clustering, antibody numbering, CDR delimiting, constructing phylogenetic tree, sequence similarity heat map, V-gene determination and abundance analysis by just clicking the buttons. Abalign allows the high-throughput analysis for BCR sequencing data, which can be finished in 850 minutes for 1 Gb DNA fasta sequences through a single thread by a notebook equipped with I7 10870H. Abalign is a powerful and efficient tool for biological researchers to analyze massive amounts of BCR or antibody sequences and get new discovery in immunoinformatic study.
